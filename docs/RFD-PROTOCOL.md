# Reality-First Development (RFD) Protocol
## Spec-Driven Application Development System

### Executive Summary
RFD Protocol is a **unified** drop-in system that bridges the gap between AI-assisted development and concrete, measurable progress. It addresses SDLC drift by enforcing reality checkpoints that validate actual progress rather than theoretical planning.

### ðŸš¨ Critical Update: Unified Architecture Decision
After extensive analysis, we've determined that **one unified system** serves all users better than progressive tiers. Solo developers need the SAME guardrails as large teams - they have nobody else to catch mistakes.

### Bootstrap Implementation Strategy
Due to the paradox of needing RFD to build RFD, we employ **Progressive Self-Hosting**:
1. Build minimal verification first (`verify.py`)
2. Use it to verify subsequent development
3. Each completed component helps build the next
4. Full system emerges through controlled evolution

### Core Philosophy

#### What Actually Matters
- **Code that runs** > Perfect architecture
- **One working feature** > Ten planned features  
- **Real data** > Mocked responses
- **Automated checks** > Manual reviews

### Problem Statement
Current AI LLM agent development suffers from:
- SDLC drift where both HUMAN (HITL) and AI agents wander without concrete validation
- Disconnected powerful tools (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GitHub Spec Kit) with no unified bridge
- Lack of reality checkpoints that PROVE progress
- Over-planning without execution validation
- Memory management issues across sessions
- Inconsistent standardization leading to process drift

### Standardization Requirements

#### AGENTS.md Schema (Strict YAML Frontmatter)
```yaml
---
version: 1.0
agent_type: [orchestrator|executor|validator|monitor]
capabilities:
  - capability_1
  - capability_2
dependencies:
  - dependency_1
checkpoints:
  - checkpoint_1
  - checkpoint_2
validation:
  - test_1
  - test_2
---
```

#### Reality Checkpoints
1. **Code Execution**: Must run without errors
2. **Test Passage**: Automated test validation

- Executes against RFD-SPEC.md
- Validates at each checkpoint

#### 3. Validation Phase
- Automated checkpoint verification

### Implementation Priorities (Bootstrap Approach)

#### Stage 1: Minimal Verification âœ… COMPLETE
- Basic Python script (`verify.py`)
- Detect when AI lies about creating files
- Manual execution for immediate use
- **Purpose**: Prevent hallucination while building rest of system

#### Stage 2: Core CLI Structure (CURRENT FOCUS)
- Extract from existing RFD-PLAN.md
- Basic commands: `init`, `check`, `validate`
- PROJECT.md template generation
- **Verification**: Use Stage 1 to verify our work

#### Stage 3: Validation Engine
- File existence checking
- Syntax validation
- Test execution
- **Verification**: Use Stage 2 CLI to validate

#### Stage 4: Session Management
- SQLite state persistence
- Context generation for AI
- Feature tracking
- **Verification**: Use Stage 3 validation

#### Stage 5: Full Integration
- CLAUDE.md generation
- Memory persistence
- Complete workflow
- **Verification**: System validates itself

### Why Unified Over Tiered
- Solo developers have MORE need for guardrails (no team backup)
- Best practices benefit everyone equally
- Complexity comes from fragmentation, not features
- One well-designed system > Five minimal ones

### Constraints & Requirements

- **MUST** be drop-in compatible with any project
- **MUST** use standardized YAML frontmatter (no variations)
- **MUST** enforce reality checkpoints
- **MUST** prevent process drift
- **MUST** integrate with Claude Code CLI
- **MUST** support both new and existing projects
- **MUST** maintain minimal file footprint
- **MUST** provide single entry point (`rfd`)

### Future Considerations

- Multi-agent orchestration
- Distributed checkpoint validation
- Cross-project memory sharing
- Advanced drift detection algorithms
- Real-time progress dashboards
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

### Conclusion

RFD Protocol bridges the gap between powerful but disconnected tools, creating a unified system that enforces reality-first development. By focusing on concrete checkpoints and automated validation, it ensures that both human developers and AI agents stay on track, producing working code rather than endless documentation.

The system's strength lies in its simplicity, strict standardization, and unwavering focus on proving progress through reality validation rather than theoretical planning.
