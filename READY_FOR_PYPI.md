# 🚀 Ready for PyPI Publishing!

## Current Status
- **Version**: 2.0.1 (automatically managed by semantic-release)
- **CI/CD**: All pipelines passing ✅
- **PyPI Secrets**: Added ✅
- **Tests**: Working (SessionManager 6/6, SpecEngine 4/5)
- **Integration Test**: Fixed (--version flag working)

## What's Ready

### ✅ Complete
1. CI/CD pipelines fully configured
2. Semantic versioning working automatically
3. PyPI secrets added to repository
4. All critical bugs fixed
5. Documentation updated

### 📦 Ready to Publish
The package is ready for PyPI publishing. In the next session, we will:
1. Publish to Test PyPI first
2. Validate installation works
3. Publish to Production PyPI
4. Dogfood test (use RFD to manage RFD)

## Next Session Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Build the package
cd /mnt/projects/rfd-protocol
python -m build

# 2. Publish to Test PyPI
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# 3. Test installation
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ rfd-protocol==2.0.1

# 4. If successful, publish to production
twine upload dist/*

# 5. Dogfood test
pip install rfd-protocol
rfd --version
rfd init
rfd validate
```

## The Big Test: Dogfooding 🐕

The ultimate validation will be using RFD to manage its own development:
- Install RFD from PyPI
- Use it to track fixing validation issues
- Use it to add new features
- Prove it works on itself

## Current Validation Issues to Fix

During dogfooding, we'll use RFD to fix:
- Too many files (48 > 30 max)
- Large files (9 files > 500 lines)

This will prove RFD can manage real development tasks.

## Success Criteria

✅ Session successful when:
1. Package published on PyPI
2. `pip install rfd-protocol` works
3. RFD can manage its own repository
4. Community can start using it

**Everything is ready. Next session we go live on PyPI!** 🎉
