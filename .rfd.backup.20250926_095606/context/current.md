# Current Session: automated_qa_cycles

## Feature Specification
Implement automated QA and review cycles with multi-stage validation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
Automated review triggers work; Code-QA-Fix loops are enforced; Review handoffs between agents functional

## Current Status
```
rfd validate --feature automated_qa_cycles
✅ max_files: 49 files (max: 50)
❌ feature_automated_qa_cycles: Implement automated QA and review cycles with multi-stage validation - building
✅ database: Database found: .rfd/memory.db
```

## Required Actions
1. Make all validation tests pass
2. Ensure code follows .rfd/config.yaml constraints
3. No mocks - use real implementations

## Commands
```bash
rfd build          # Build current feature
rfd validate       # Check if tests pass
rfd checkpoint     # Save working state
```

## Constraints from .rfd/config.yaml
- NO new features until 100% tests pass
- MUST use RFD workflow for all fixes
- MUST validate each fix with tests
- NO mock data in tests
- MUST maintain backward compatibility
