# Current Session: fix_critical_issues

## Feature Specification
Fix critical broken functionality preventing RFD from working

**Acceptance Criteria:**
Session persistence works, PyPI package installs and runs, tests have real assertions, dogfooding is real

## Current Status
```
./rfd validate --feature fix_critical_issues
✅ max_files: 35 files (max: 50)
❌ feature_fix_critical_issues: Fix critical broken functionality preventing RFD from working - pending
✅ database: Database found: .rfd/memory.db
```

## Required Actions
1. Make all validation tests pass
2. Ensure code follows PROJECT.md constraints
3. No mocks - use real implementations

## Commands
```bash
./rfd build          # Build current feature
./rfd validate       # Check if tests pass
./rfd checkpoint     # Save working state
```

## Constraints from PROJECT.md
- NO new features until 100% tests pass
- MUST use RFD workflow for all fixes
- MUST validate each fix with tests
- NO mock data in tests
- MUST maintain backward compatibility
