❌ feature_rfd_core_features: Implement missing RFD features for true dogfooding - pending
✅ database: Database found: .rfd/memory.db
```

## Required Actions
1. Make all validation tests pass
2. Ensure code follows PROJECT.md constraints
3. No mocks - use real implementations

## Commands
```bash
./rfd build          # Build current feature
./rfd validate       # Check if tests pass
./rfd checkpoint     # Save working state
```

## Constraints from PROJECT.md
- NO new features until 100% tests pass
- MUST use RFD workflow for all fixes
