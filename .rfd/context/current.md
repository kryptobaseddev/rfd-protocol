# Current Session: test_context

## Feature Specification
Test automated context generation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
Test automated context generation is complete and working

## Current Status
```
./rfd validate --feature test_context
✅ max_files: 45 files (max: 50)
❌ feature_test_context: Test automated context generation - building
✅ database: Database found: .rfd/memory.db
```

## Required Actions
1. Make all validation tests pass
2. Ensure code follows .rfd/config.yaml constraints
3. No mocks - use real implementations

## Commands
```bash
./rfd build          # Build current feature
./rfd validate       # Check if tests pass
./rfd checkpoint     # Save working state
```

## Constraints from .rfd/config.yaml
- NO new features until 100% tests pass
- MUST use RFD workflow for all fixes
- MUST validate each fix with tests
- NO mock data in tests
- MUST maintain backward compatibility
