## ðŸš€ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES (Phase 8)

### Priority 1: Practice What We Preach
**Issue**: Our own project still has remnants from bootstrap chaos  
**Action**: Implement our own RFD-TESTING-STANDARDS.md  
**Files**: Clean up HANDOFF.md outdated sections, organize properly

### Priority 2: Real-World Dogfooding
**Goal**: Create actual working project with Nexus RFD Protocol  
**Test**: End-to-end workflow from `./rfd init` to deployment  
**Validate**: System works in real scenarios, not just tests

### Priority 3: Branding Consistency  
**Change**: "RFD Nexus Protocol" â†’ "Nexus RFD Protocol"  
**Standard**: "Nexus" = company brand, "RFD Protocol" = product suite  
**Files**: Update all documentation for consistent naming

1. **HANDOFF.md** - Updated with Phase 8 priorities
2. **PRODUCTION-READY-v1.0.md** - Full v1.0 achievement summary
