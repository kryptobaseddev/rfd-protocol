# RFD Reality Check - 2025-09-24

## Verified Working Features ✅

### 1. Session Persistence - VERIFIED ✅
```python
Current session: {'id': 4, 'feature_id': 'fix_critical_issues', 'started_at': '2025-09-23T22:26:53.820325'}
```
- Sessions DO persist across restarts
- Active session loads on RFD init
- Database-backed storage works

### 2. Database-First Features - VERIFIED ✅
```sql
sqlite3 .rfd/memory.db "SELECT id, status FROM features;"
```
Shows all features stored in database:
- session_manager_fixes|complete
- spec_engine_fixes|complete
- integration_test_fixes|complete
- rfd_dogfooding|complete
- rfd_core_features|complete
- mock_detection|complete
- fix_critical_issues|complete

Features MUST exist in database before starting session (not PROJECT.md).

### 3. Mock Detection - VERIFIED ✅
Tested with sample file containing mock data:
- Correctly detects "test_user", "dummy_data", "mock response"
- Returns: `Has mocks: True, Findings: 2 mock patterns found`
- AIClaimValidator.detect_mock_data() works as expected

### 4. Real Test Assertions - VERIFIED ✅
Tests now use proper assertions:
```python
assert False, "Test failed"
assert 1 + 1 == 2
```
No more fake `return True/False` patterns.

### 5. Package Installation - VERIFIED ✅
```bash
$ pip list | grep rfd
rfd-protocol                 2.3.0
$ which rfd
/home/keatonhoskins/.local/bin/rfd
$ rfd --version
rfd, version 2.3.0
```

## CRITICAL PROBLEM: Improper Dogfooding ❌

**WE ARE VIOLATING OUR OWN PRINCIPLES!**

### The Problem:
1. We have a local `./rfd` script that directly imports from `src/rfd/`
2. This bypasses the installed pip package
3. We're giving ourselves special treatment - NOT true dogfooding

### Evidence:
```python
# ./rfd file (WRONG!)
#!/usr/bin/env python3
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'src'))
from rfd.cli import cli
```

### What Proper Dogfooding Looks Like:
- Install via: `pip install rfd-protocol`
- Use via: `rfd` command (from PATH)
- NO local scripts that import from src/
- NO special .rfd/ functionality that isn't in the package
- Treat this project like ANY OTHER project using RFD

## The Truth About RFD

### What Actually Works:
- ✅ Session persistence (database-backed)
- ✅ Database-first feature management
- ✅ Mock detection capabilities
- ✅ Real test assertions
- ✅ Package builds and installs

### What's Broken:
- ❌ We're not actually dogfooding properly
- ❌ Using local ./rfd script instead of installed package
- ❌ May have special functionality not in the pip package

### Unverified Claims:
- "Drops error rate from 48% to ~0%" - No evidence
- "Always recoverable from any state" - Not tested
- "Works with any tech stack" - Only Python tested

## Required Fixes

1. **Remove ./rfd script** - Force use of installed package
2. **Test with clean install** - Verify pip package works standalone
3. **No special src/ imports** - Everything through installed package
4. **Verify all features via pip package** - Not local code

## Bottom Line

RFD has real working features, but we're cheating on dogfooding. We must:
1. Delete ./rfd 
2. Use only `rfd` command from pip package
3. Ensure .rfd/ directory works like any other project

Until we fix this, we're not truly dogfooding RFD.
