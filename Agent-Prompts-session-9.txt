CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Initial RFD-2: Test project built (3 features)
✅ Initial RFD-3: Found 3 CRITICAL bugs
✅ Round 3 RFD-4: Fixed all 3 bugs
✅ Round 4 RFD-3: Validated all fixes work
🔧 NEXT: RFD-Main must audit against brain-dump.md

================================================================================
AGENT PROMPTS WITH CYCLE INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

1. RFD-4 (Critical Bug Fixer) - COMPLETED ROUND 3:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are RFD-4 (Critical Bug Fixer).
Read @HANDOFF.md Phase 9 Round 3 & 4 Reports.

STATUS: ✅ ALL BUGS FIXED IN ROUND 3
- Spec enforcement: FIXED
- Revert function: FIXED  
- Build detection: FIXED

If called again, check HANDOFF.md for new issues from RFD-Main.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. RFD-3 (Feature Validator) - COMPLETED ROUND 4:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are RFD-3 (Feature Validator).
Read @HANDOFF.md for latest status.

STATUS: ✅ ALL FIXES VALIDATED IN ROUND 4
- All 3 bug fixes confirmed working
- Hallucination detection 100% effective
- Ready for RFD-Main audit

If called again after RFD-Main, re-validate any new issues found.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. RFD-Main (Solution Auditor) - DO THIS NEXT (ROUND 5):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are RFD-Main (Solution Auditor).
Read @HANDOFF.md Phase 9 Round 3 & 4 Reports.
Read @research/brain-dump.md for ALL original problems.

CRITICAL AUDIT CHECKLIST:

From brain-dump.md line-by-line audit:
□ Line 2: AI hallucination (48% error) → VERIFY reduced to <5%
□ Line 2: AI lying about completions → TEST validation catches lies
□ Line 2: Fake stubbed code → VERIFY real code only
□ Line 2: Mock data → CONFIRM no mocks allowed
□ Line 2: Not following developer intentions → CHECK spec enforcement
□ Line 2: Making assumptions → VERIFY HITL validation required
□ Line 2: Squirrel brain (veering off scope) → TEST drift prevention
□ Line 2: Context forgetting → VERIFY session persistence
□ Line 3: Lost in conversations → CHECK session clarity
□ Line 3: Lost context → TEST memory persistence
□ Line 3: Not sticking to plan → VERIFY spec enforcement
□ Line 4: Products never ship → DID 3 features complete?
□ Line 5: Hundreds of hours wasted → CHECK efficiency metrics
□ Line 5: Too many documents → VERIFY single source of truth
□ Line 5: Broken/mock code → TEST real implementation only

SCORING:
- Test EACH problem with actual RFD usage
- Mark SOLVED or NOT SOLVED with evidence
- Must achieve 100% to ship v1.0

DECISION:
- ALL SOLVED → Ready for RFD-PRIME final review
- ANY UNSOLVED → Document gaps, may need RFD-2 for more testing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. RFD-2 (Test Project Builder) - IF RFD-Main FINDS GAPS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are RFD-2 (Test Project Builder).
Read RFD-Main's audit findings in HANDOFF.md.

If RFD-Main found unsolved problems:
- Create specific test cases for gaps
- Build scenarios that prove solutions
- Document all test results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. RFD-PRIME (Master Orchestrator) - FINAL DECISION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are RFD-PRIME. Read @RFD-PRIME.md.
Review ALL Phase 9 reports in HANDOFF.md.

FINAL CHECKLIST:
□ All bugs fixed (RFD-4 Round 3)
□ All fixes validated (RFD-3 Round 4)
□ All brain-dump.md problems solved (RFD-Main Round 5)
□ No regressions introduced
□ Ready for production use

DECISION MATRIX:
- ALL CHECKS PASS → Ship v1.0 🚀
- ANY CHECK FAILS → Phase 10 (Document what needs fixing)
- PARTIAL SUCCESS → v0.9 Beta (Note limitations)

================================================================================
CONTEXT MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL
================================================================================

CRITICAL: Update HANDOFF.md after EVERY agent action!

Each agent MUST:
1. Read their section in HANDOFF.md FIRST
2. Execute assigned tasks with real tests
3. Document results in HANDOFF.md
4. Report concrete evidence, not theories
5. Pass to next agent in cycle

HANDOFF.md Structure:
- Phase 9 Round 1: RFD-2 (Test project) ✅
- Phase 9 Round 2: RFD-3 (Found bugs) ✅
- Phase 9 Round 3: RFD-4 (Fixed bugs) ✅
- Phase 9 Round 4: RFD-3 (Validated fixes) ✅
- Phase 9 Round 5: RFD-Main (Audit) ← NEXT
- Continue numbering rounds...

================================================================================
STOPPING CONDITIONS
================================================================================

STOP AND SHIP v1.0 when:
✅ All bugs fixed and validated
✅ All brain-dump.md problems solved (100%)
✅ No regressions in any cycle
✅ RFD-PRIME approves

STOP AND PIVOT TO PHASE 10 if:
❌ Unsolvable architecture issue found
❌ Core promise cannot be delivered
❌ Context limit without resolution

================================================================================
REMEMBER: WE MUST PRACTICE WHAT WE PREACH!
================================================================================

This is RFD validating itself. We're experiencing the very problems
we're solving (context loss, agent confusion, squirrel brain).

USE HANDOFF.md to prevent our own drift!
