3. **Semantic Versioning Configuration**
   - Added `.cz.toml` for commitizen configuration
   - Configured automatic version bumping on conventional commits
   - Set up proper commit parsing for feat/fix/breaking changes

4. **PyPI Publishing Documentation**
   - Created `PYPI_SETUP.md` with detailed instructions
   - Clarified that `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatic (not a user secret)
   - Documented required secrets: `PYPI_API_TOKEN` and `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN`

### ✅ Test Improvements

1. **SessionManager Tests (6/6 passing)**
   - Fixed all 6 SessionManager test failures
   - Updated tests to use correct API methods (store_context/get_context)
   - Tests now use actual feature IDs from PROJECT.md

   - Added missing methods: add_feature, update_feature_status, validate_spec, create
   - Fixed validate method to accept optional spec parameter
   - Updated tests to include required fields

3. **Database Setup**
   - Created SQLite database with required tables
   - Database validation now passes

## Current Metrics

- **SessionManager Tests**: 6/6 passing ✅
- **SpecEngine Tests**: 4/5 passing (1 skipped) ✅
- **Database**: Configured and operational ✅
- **CI Pipeline**: Production-ready ✅
- **Coverage**: 13.29% (improving)

## Commits Made

1. `chore: clean up coverage artifacts`
2. `fix: SessionManager tests and database setup`
3. `feat: production-ready CI/CD pipelines`
4. `docs: add comprehensive session summary`
5. `fix: CI/CD pipeline and semantic versioning setup`
6. `fix: SpecEngine tests and add missing API methods`

## Next Steps

1. **Repository Owner Actions Required**:
   - Add `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret to GitHub repository
   - Add `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret (optional but recommended)
   - See `PYPI_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

2. **Remaining Work**:
   - Fix integration test failures (12 remaining)
   - Reduce file count from 48 to under 30
   - Split large files exceeding 500 lines

## Testing the Setup

After secrets are added:
```bash
# Test CI pipeline
git push origin main

# Check GitHub Actions
# https://github.com/kryptobaseddev/rfd-protocol/actions

# Manual release test
# Go to Actions → Release Pipeline → Run workflow
```

## Semantic Versioning

The project is now configured for automatic version bumping:
- `fix:` commits → patch version (1.0.x)
- `feat:` commits → minor version (1.x.0)
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` → major version (x.0.0)

Version is synchronized across:
- pyproject.toml
- src/rfd/__init__.py
- Git tags (v1.0.0 format)
